## Load the required R libraries
There are many nice libraries that support statistics in R. I recommend the following:

```{r}

```

In addition to that, we want to load, manipulate and visualize our data from excel:

```{r}
library(readxl)
library(openxlsx)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)
library(ggpubr)
```
